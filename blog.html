                                store and access data right in the browser.<br>
                                <b>Session Storage:</b> Session Storage is a type of web storage that allows web
                                applications to store data locally within the user's browser. Unlike cookies, data
                                stored in session storage is specific to the site on which it was created and data is
                                not shared with other sites. <br> <br>
                                <b>Local Storage:</b> The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB. <br>
                                <b>Session Storage:</b> The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB. <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>Local Storage:</b> As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or
                                manually. <br>
                                <b>Session Storage:</b> Itâ€™s session-based and works per window or tab. This means that
                                data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is
                                closed.

                                <b>Local Storage:</b>The stored data is not deleted when the browser is closed. <br>
                                <b>Session Storage:</b> The data is stored only for the session and will be deleted when
                                the
                                browser is closed. <br>

                                <b>Local Storage:</b> Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need
                                to
                                access later, such as offline data. <br>

                                <b>Session Storage:</b> Session storage is a great way to improve the performance of
                                the web
                                applications. <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>Local Storage:</b> This is especially useful for storing data that the user want to
                                persist
                                even if the user closes the browser, such as preferences or settings. <br>
                                <b>Session Storage:</b> Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive,
                                such as
                                login credentials.

                            <p><b>Global Scope:</b></p>
                            <p> 1. Any variable declared outside of a function is said to have
                                Global Scope. <br>
                                2. In simple terms, a variable that can be accessed anywhere in the program is known as
                                a variable with global scope. Globally scoped variables can be defined using any of the
                                three keywords: let, const, and var. <br>
                                3. A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is why a global variable is
                                available for use throughout the entire program after its declaration. <br>
                                4. If the global variable is not initialized, then zero is stored as default. <br>
                                5. The global variable stored on a fixed location decided by the compiler. <br>
                                6. Data sharing is possible as multiple functions can access the same global variable.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                            </p>
                            <p><b>Block Scope:</b></p>
                            <p> 1. Before introducing ES6 (ECMAScript 6) in 2015, JavaScript had only two types of
                                scopes: Global Scope and Local Scope. <br>
                                2. With the introduction of let and const keywords, it added a new type of Scope in
                                JavaScript. One cannot access the variables declared inside a particular block
                                (represented by {}) from outside the block. <br>
                                3. The block scope does not work with the var keyword. The programmers can either use
                                let or const
                                keywords for that. <br>
                                4. A block scope is the area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops.
                                Generally speaking, whenever the programmers see {curly brackets}, it is a block. In
                                ES6,
                                const and let keywords allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which
                                means those variables exist only within the corresponding block. <br>
                                5. Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the
                                scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of
                                loops, or conditional statements, or something else. The programmers are only allowed to
                                refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.
