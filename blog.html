                            <p><b>Local Storage:</b> Local Storage is a type of web storage that allows JavaScript to
                                store and access data right in the browser.<br>
                                <b>Session Storage:</b> Session Storage is a type of web storage that allows web
                                applications to store data locally within the user's browser. Unlike cookies, data
                                stored in session storage is specific to the site on which it was created and data is
                                not shared with other sites. <br> <br>
                                <b>Local Storage:</b> The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB. <br>
                                <b>Session Storage:</b> The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB. <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>Local Storage:</b> As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or
                                manually. <br>
                                <b>Session Storage:</b> Itâ€™s session-based and works per window or tab. This means that
                                data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is
                                closed.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>Local Storage:</b>The stored data is not deleted when the browser is closed. <br>
                                <b>Session Storage:</b> The data is stored only for the session and will be deleted when
                                the
                                browser is closed. <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>Local Storage:</b> Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need
                                to
                                access later, such as offline data. <br>

                                <b>Session Storage:</b> Session storage is a great way to improve the performance of
                                the web
                                applications. <br>
                                <br>
                                <b>Local Storage:</b> This is especially useful for storing data that the user want to
                                persist
                                even if the user closes the browser, such as preferences or settings. <br>
                                <b>Session Storage:</b> Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive,
                                such as
                                login credentials.
